Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/lung-cancer-screening

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is not* effective. However, heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> was '[substantial](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at 61%. This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below)

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) as well as the number of rounds of screening, find that the outcome of the intervention is effected by these factors.

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that combines methods of scoping, rapid, and living systematic reviews.  This analysis updates one or more previously published review(s) below. A comparison of studies included in this review compared to prior reviews are in the table, [reconciliation of trials included with prior meta-analyses/](files/reconciliation-tables/Reconciliation%20of%20studies.pdf). Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references.
